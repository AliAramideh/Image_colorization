# Image_colorization
Image Colorization using Autoencoder

The following things have been done in this project
- Download the "landscape image colorization" dataset and slice it to `train_set`, `validation_set` and `test_set`.
- Design and train an AutoEncoder using `PyTorch` (not `TensorFlow`) on the dataset to colorize grayscale images
- Plot learning curve and visualize grayscale images of test set, their corresponding color images and their colorized versions side by side.
